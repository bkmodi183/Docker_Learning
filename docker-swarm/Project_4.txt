Project 1: Simple ToDo App Service from the Docker Image

1. Create three nodes → one master node and two worker nodes.
2. Run docker swarm init → this command initializes the Docker Swarm mode on the current node and makes it the master node.
3. Once you run docker swarm init on one of the nodes and officially make it the master node, it will generate a join token that allows other nodes to join the swarm as           workers. Before joining the worker nodes, make sure that the security group or firewall of the master node allows inbound traffic on port 2377, which is required for 
   worker nodes to connect to the swarm network.
4. In this way, the Swarm network is created, connecting all nodes (master and workers) together under one cluster.
5. Run docker service create --name todo-app-service --replicas 3 --publish 8001:8001 bkmodi183/todo-app-repo:latest → this command creates a Docker service named todo-app-       service. Here, the --name flag assigns a name to the service, --replicas defines how many container instances (tasks) should run across the Swarm, and --publish exposes 
   the port on which the service will be accessible.
6. Note: When we publish a port while creating a service, the same port automatically becomes available on all nodes (master and workers). We do not need to expose ports          separately for each worker node — that’s one of the key features of Docker Swarm’s built-in load balancing.
7. Run docker service ls → execute this on the master node to see the list of running services within the Swarm cluster.
8. Run docker ps → this command shows the list of containers currently running on that particular node (master or worker).
9. Now the project is ready — containers are running across all three nodes as part of the Docker Swarm cluster. You can verify that multiple replicas of the service are          distributed across available worker nodes for load balancing and high availability.
10. You can kill a container on one of the worker nodes, and within seconds, a new container will automatically be created by the master node to maintain the desired 
    replica count. This behavior demonstrates Docker Swarm’s auto-healing and self-recovery mechanism, ensuring continuous availability of your application.
