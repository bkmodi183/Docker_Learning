Questions:

1. Why we need docker swarm
2. why we can't use docker in production
3. what is docker swarm
4. how docker swarm is different than kubernetes -> swarm is native to docker engine and k8 is all together a different tool
5. Note: let's say a docker swarm architecture has 3 worker nodes and all three are running one container of todo-app. let's say worker 1 removed from the swarm by the command
   docker swarm leave then in this case all the data or the task that the particular node is running with will automatically gets deleted. That's the beauty of docker swarm
   that it is  secure no data leakes to worker node.
7. in the above scenario if we kill the container from worker 2 so within a sec the docker master node will automatically creates another container. 
8. docker swarm node ls -> only works on master node. if we run the command on worker node it will show and error response.
